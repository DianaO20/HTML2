            <h3>One of the great reasons that signify the importance of book reading in our life is that books act as
                our best friends.
                Friends are one of the most important parts of our life. We canâ€™t imagine our life without the
                companionship of a good friend.
                Similarly, a book is like a best friend that constantly inspires us to become the best versions of
                ourselves.
                Books enrich our minds with knowledge just like a good friend. </h3>

                            <p>
                            <h4>The novel follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the
                                book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the
                                difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness.

                                Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his
                                property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an
                                inheritance, so his family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative
                                that at least one of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a
                                motivation that drives the plot. </h5>

                    <h3><i> The Great Gatsby</i>
                        <h3>
                            <p>
                            <h4>The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz
                                Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick
                                Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to
                                reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.

                                The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King,
                                and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a
                                move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He
                                submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over
                                the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text,
                                but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives.
                                Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he
                                incorporated its imagery into the novel.</h4>

                                <h4> The new novel by George Orwell is the major work towards which all his previous
                                    writing has pointed. Critics have hailed it as his "most solid, most brilliant"
                                    work. Though the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four takes place thirty-five years hence,
                                    it is in every sense timely. The scene is London, where there has been no new
                                    housing since 1950 and where the city-wide slums are called Victory Mansions.
